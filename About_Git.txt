--> GIT -
GIT allows the user to move to any point within a software i.e., to a particular version (version control).

->Version control system - tracks files for changes. Git is a version control system that allows you to track 
changes to your files and collaborate with others. Its used to manage the history of your code and to merge 
changes from different branches.
- Version controls systems are used to manage the history of your code. They allow you to track changes to your 
file and to collaborate with others, version control system are essential for software development. 
- Consider version control as check point in a game. You can move to any point in the game and you can always go 
back to the previous check point. This is the same concept in software development.
- Before git became mainstream, version control systems were used by developers to manage their code. They were 
used by developers to manage their code. They were called SCCS (SOurce code control system). SCCS was a 
proprietary software that was used to manage the history of code. It was expensive and not very friendly. Git was 
created to replace SCCS and to make version control more accessible and user friendly. Some common version 
control systems are Subversion (SVN), CVS and perforce, Mercury.

-> GIT and GITHUB are different - 
- Git is version control system that is used to track changes to your files. Its a free and open source software
that is available for window, macOS and linux. Remember git is a software that can be installed on your computer.
- Github is a web based hosting service for git repositories. Github is an online platform that allows you to 
store and share your code with others. Its a popular platform for developers to collab on projects and to share 
code. Its not that Github is the only provider of git repositories but one of the most popular ones.

-> Terminology - 
- To check the version, you can rin the following command : (git --version) ot (git -v)
This command will display the version of git installed on your system. Git is a very stable software and don't 
get any breaking changes in majority of cases.

- Repository : A repository is a collection of files and directories that are stored togeather. Its a way to 
store and manage your code. A repository is like a folder on your computer, but its more than just a folder. It 
can contain other files, folder and even other reepositories. You can think of a repository as a container that 
holds all your code.
    - There's a difference between a software on your software vs tracking a particular folder on your system. At
    any point you can run the following command to see the current state of your repository - (git status).
    Not all folder are meant to be tracked by git.

-> Your configuration settings - 
- Git has a lot of settings that you can change. You can change your username, email and other settings. Whenever
you check point your changes, git will add some information about your such as your username and email to commit.
There's a git config file that stores all the setting that you have changed. You can make settings like what 
editor you would like to use etc. There are some global setting and some repository specific settings.
(git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com")...
(git config --global user.name "your name")...
- Now you can check your config settings 
(git config --list) - this will show you all the settings that you have changed.


-> Creating a repository -
Creating a repository is creating a new folder on your system and initializing it as a git repository. Its just a
regular folder to code your projecct, you are just asking git to track it. To create a repository, you can use 
the following command - (git status) - shows the current state of your repository. (git init) - command will 
create a new folder on your system and initialize it as a git repository. This adds a hidden .git folder on your
project.
