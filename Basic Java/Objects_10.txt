-->OBJECTS -
As we know that an object is a collection of data that provides a set of methods. For eg: a String is a 
collection of characters that provides methods like charAt and substring. As we know Java is object oriented that
is it uses object to represent data and provides methods related to them. This way of organizing programs is a 
powerful design concept.
