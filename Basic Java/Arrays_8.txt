--> ARRAYS -
->CREATING ARRAYS -
An array is a sequence of values; the values in the array are called elements but the values in the array must be
of similar data type. To create an array, you have to declare a varaible with an array type and the create the 
array itself. Array types look like other Java types, except they're followed by square brackets ([]). For eg:
        int [] arr;
To create array itself, you have to use the new operator. You can use any integer expression for the size of 
array, as long as the value is non-negative. Iy you try to create an array with -4 elements, for example, you'll
get a NegativeArraySizeException. An array with zero elements is allowed, and there are special uses for such 
arrays that we'll see later on.

-> ACCESSING ELEMENTS -
When you create an array of ints, the elements are intialized by zero. The figure below shows a state diagram of
the counts array so far.
            counts[] ----> [ 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
                             0   1   2   3
The arrow indicates that the value of counts is a reference to the array. Think of the array and the variable 
that refers to it as two different things. The numbers inside the brackets are elements of array. The small 
numbers outside the the boxes are called indices used to identify each location in the array. 
The [] operator selects elements from an array. You can use the [] operator anywhere in the expression.
